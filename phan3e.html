                That is the burning desire of Nguyen Thanh Tung, born in 1984 in
                Ben Tre, who excellently received a Master’s scholarship from
                the Australian Government in 2016.

              <p>
                Shortly after graduating from the University of Social sciences
                and Humanities in Ho Chi Minh City with a major in English, Tung
                worked at Disability Research and Capacity Development (DRD), an
                organization that provides free and comprehensive support for
                people suffering from disabilities. Some of the support includes
                scholarship programmes, skills training courses, exchange study
                schemes, job opportunities, and capacity building for people
                with disabilities.

            As Tung recalls, when he studied at the University, his class was on
            the 3rd floor of the non-elevator building, while the restrooms were
            on the first floor. For people with mobility impairments, going up
            and down several times in a day is a severe challenge

            From his own experiences, understanding the difficulties faced by
            people suffering from disabilities when integrating into society,
            Tung wishes to be able to do something to improve the accessibility
            of people with disabilities at universities or in society in
            general. That’s also the motivation for him to apply for a Master's
            scholarship with a major in People with Disabilities, with the
            ultimate aim of improving his knowledge and skills whilst also
            helping his friends, colleagues, and disadvantaged individuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Tung, compared to more than a decade ago, traffic
            infrastructure throughout major cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh
            City today has undergone improvements. However, they are ultimately
            still not friendly for people with disabilities.

              In some places, ramps are made specifically for wheelchairs.
              However, to prevent motorbikes, barriers are installed. This
              accessible facility inadvertently turns into “inaccessible”
              because disabled individuals are unable to move. Similarly, in
              some parks, barriers are installed at the entrances, thereby
              halting wheelchair users from approaching

            Although the Government, ministries, and relevant branches have
            developed sets of accessibility regulations and standards for
            construction works to improve the situation, whilst there are also
            certain works paying attention to the disabled-friendly design and
            construction, many other works still do not strictly follow the

          <p>
            Accessible traffic infrastructure and spaces for people suffering
            from disabilities hasn’t been fully implemented yet. In some places,
            certain parts are implemented to be accessible. However, such
            accessibility infrastructure hasn’t been correctly and fully used.

            Furthermore, new projects only focus on improving accessibility
            infrastructure for people with mobility impairments, without having
            accessible infrastructure for the blind such as tactile paving and
            braille panels.

            The renovation of some old buildings is not occurring in accordance
            with relevant standards, for example the U-turn is often too short
            whilst ramps run too steep or too long. Many ramps with excessively
            steep slopes have no handrails, making it difficult for wheelchair
            users. Restaurants and amusement parks are still inaccessible to
            wheelchair users.

            Most people with disabilities need the support of other people when
            using public transport. According to Tung, taxis in Vietnam haven’t
            been designed to support wheelchair users, meaning they have to rely
            on the assistance of taxi drivers.

              The State pays more attention to the process of implementing
              policies, as well as increasing sanctions against investors and

              disabilities that do not meet standards and regulations.

            According to Tung, the most important factor is that authorities,
            people, and society need to change the perception and have proper
            assessment of the abilities, values, and contributions of people
            with disabilities. It can therefore be considered necessary to see
            them as other members of society and ensure their equal rights.

              Vietnam always attaches importance to promoting and protecting the
              rights and interests of people with disabilities on the basis of
              equality and non-discrimination. People with disabilities
              themselves also aspire to integrate into the community, seeking
              more opportunities and assert themselves. However, to achieve
              this, policies need to be synchronous and consistent and the
              implementation process must be efficient on the basis of
              respecting values and contributions of people with disabilities.
              When roads and traffic system become friendly and accessible to
              people with disabilities, they can easily make a living and
              realize their dreams...
