                It's like walking on top of a mountain, then suddenly seeing
                nothing and falling off the cliff. That feeling is like falling
                down with no end and having no idea when my body would be
                dismembered. Many nights when I was sleeping, I was startled to
                wake up and could not see anything. I shouted, “Why is the light
                turned off?” I was really depressed. My life before was really
                good. I went to work every day. When I lost my vision, I stopped
                working. My life was tragic and I was being driven crazy.

              What I struggle with most is to walk with a plain wooden cane.
              Though it’s only 300 meters from Gao market to my home, dozens of
              motorbikes parked on the sidewalk fell over because of my
              misguided cane. At that time, I felt really bad. In addition, I
              often got my shoes stuck in drains. Years ago, drains were not as
              dry as they are now, so I had to change my shoes every three
              months.

              His shins were almost crushed because of colliding with
              motorcycles exhausts parked in the middle of the road. Therefore,
              as we meet blind people, the crisscrossing scars on their legs can
              tell stories. Those with many scars on their legs are the ones who
              go out quite often. Those who have no scars are the ones who
              couldn’t get out of their house, which is even worse.

            Some urban districts of the capital have taken measures to restore
            order on the sidewalks and reclaim pavements for pedestrians.
            However, pathways exclusive for the disabled remains a distant

            Many infrastructures have been set up exclusively for the blind on
            the sidewalks in Hoan Kiem district, Hanoi. However, they have not
            been completed yet. Some tactile pavings either don’t lead to the
            crosswalks or lead straight to the electricity poles. Without ramp
            connection, the disabled couldn’t cross the road using ramps or
            pedestrian overpasses.

              My friends often came to see me, taking me out for breakfast,
              drinking coffee or beer. They also helped describe the
              surroundings, which help me a lot to get through that difficult
              time. My family is always by my side, supporting and loving me, no

              Since joining the Blind Association, I try to learn as much as I
              can. First of all, I studied the Braille Alphabet by myself, and
              then the Blind Association’s officers encouraged me to study at
              the Youth Rehabilitation Center. Then I learned orientation and
              mobility. All of these experiences are needed for us to
              participate in social activities. Despite already being a member
              of the Communist Party of Vietnam, I was still required to study
              the Political Ideology course organized by the Blind Association.
              Without a strong mind, people will give up easily.

              them my own story and how I overcame such a dark period in my
              life. Many young members are even more determined and dynamic.

              People with disabilities hope that all policies, laws, regulations
              and Ministries related to construction issues and traffic
              accessibility will properly perform their duties and listen
              carefully to their voices. Laws must be fully implemented to avoid
              barriers. I firmly believe that if there are no impediments, then
              there are no true disabled people.
